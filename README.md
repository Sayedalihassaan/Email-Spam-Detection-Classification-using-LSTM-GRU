# Email Spam Detection Classification using LSTM & GRU

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting spam emails using advanced deep learning techniques. By leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) networks, the system classifies emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of text data, including cleaning and tokenization.
- **Model Implementation**: Use of LSTM and GRU architectures for sequential data analysis.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## Dataset
A comprehensive dataset of labeled emails was used, containing both spam and non-spam examples. (Include dataset source or mention if created.)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Text cleaning
    - Tokenization
    - Padding sequences for uniform input length
2. **Model Design**:
    - LSTM model
    - GRU model
3. **Training & Evaluation**:
    - Loss and optimization strategies
    - Model evaluation metrics

## Results
(Include performance metrics and visualizations if available from the notebook.)
